# Clinical Trial Analysis: Auralin vs. Novodra
## Project Overview
This project investigates a clinical trial involving 350 patients with elevated HbA1c levels to compare the efficacy of Auralin (oral insulin) and Novodra (injectable insulin). The study tracks insulin dosage variations, HbA1c changes, and adverse effects to assess Auralin’s viability as an alternative to Novodra.

## Project Workflow
### 1. Data Wrangling & Preparation
Compiled and cleaned structured patient records, including treatment histories and adverse reaction reports.
Addressed missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicate records for accurate analysis.
Standardized key attributes such as insulin dosage, BMI, and HbA1c levels.
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed statistical and visual analysis to explore patient demographics and treatment responses.
Identified factors influencing insulin resistance and treatment effectiveness.
Compared HbA1c level changes between the two treatment groups using data visualization techniques.
### 3. Statistical Analysis & Evaluation
Applied hypothesis testing to determine statistical significance in HbA1c reductions.
Conducted noninferiority testing to verify Auralin’s effectiveness against Novodra.
Analyzed adverse reaction trends to assess patient safety concerns.

### Key Findings
- Examined whether Auralin meets the clinical noninferiority criteria compared to Novodra.
- Evaluated real-world insulin dosage adjustments and their impact on patient health.
- Provided insights into the safety profile of both treatments based on reported side effects.
